This power BI dashboard will take you to the Power Query environment where I have done data transformed and cleaned, then load it to the Power BI environment for further analysis and and build the dashboard.

In this Power BI dashboard, I create HR using a report/dashboard with the flat file i.e. excel file. Power Query will help me to make the data clean and easy to use for analysis.

**Pizza Sales Dashboard:**


I built an interactive report that analyzed pizza sales data using PowerBI.

📌 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐋𝐋𝐄𝐍𝐆𝐄 Plato's Pizza enlisted the services of a BI Consultant to harness restaurant's data for operational improvement. Here are the questions we aimed to answer: ▪ What days and times are we the busiest? ▪ How many pizzas are we making during peak periods? ▪ What are our best and worst selling pizzas? ▪ What's our average order value?

📌 𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐀 𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐏𝐀𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 🔹 Connected CSV data source and imported 4 tables. 🔹 Conducted thorough data cleaning using Power BI's Power Query Editor. 🔹 Established data modeling with necessary relationships, creating a snowflake schema. 🔹 Implemented DAX to create essential measures for KPIs. 🔹 Designed visuals using various chart types and incorporated slicers and filters for data exploration. 🔹 Published the report to the Power BI service for accessibility.

🔑 𝐊𝐄𝐘 𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐈𝐆𝐇𝐓𝐒 Here are the standout insights from analysis: ▪ 💰 Plato's Pizza achieved an impressive $817,860 in revenue by selling a total of 49,574 pizzas through 21,350 orders over the course of a year.

▪ ⏰ The restaurant's peak hour was at 1 pm, with a staggering 2.68k orders placed during this time.

▪ 🍗 "The Thai Chicken Pizza" emerged as the superstar, contributing $43,434 in revenue and boasting 2,225 orders.

▪ 🧀 On the flip side, "The Brie Carre Pizza" had the lowest revenue, tallying just $11,588 across 480 orders.

▪ 🎩 The average order value stood strong at $38.

▪ 🍕 When it comes to pizza sizes, L and XXL options lagged behind, while L and M pizzas were customer favorites. Notably, the Classic Category pizzas saw the highest sales volume.

📌 𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 Based on analysis, I would recommend focusing on promotions, particularly on Sundays and Mondays. As data indicates that these days experience lower order volumes and revenue, presenting an opportunity for improvement.
