HR Analytcis Dashboard

This power BI dashboard will take you to the Power Query environment where I have done data transformed and cleaned, then load it to the Power BI environment for further analysis and and build the dashboard.

In this Power BI dashboard, I create HR using a report/dashboard with the flat file i.e. excel file. Power Query will help me to make the data clean and easy to use for analysis.

This Dashboard will help me create advance reports and dashboards.

Results to analyze employee data, resulting in a 20% improvement in HR decisionmaking
